          <h2>Houston Texas Temple</h2>
          <p>The Houston Texas Temple is the 97th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). After the September 1997 announcement that the LDS Church would build a temple in Houston, the search began for an appropriate site. The site chosen formerly belonged to a developer unwilling to sell. Years earlier, however, the developer had gone through difficult financial times and had made a promise to God that if God would help him avoid financial ruin, he would someday "pay God back". When the developer learned what was proposed to be built on his land, he decided to sell the land as his way of paying God back. </p>
